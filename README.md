### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to provide additional information to W. Avy about temperatures in Oahu so he can make the best decision about opening an ice-cream and surf shop. We needed to collect the temperatures for the months of June and December to see how sustainable the ice-cream sales would be year-round. The summary statistics have been generated for both months so we could easily analyze our findings.

### Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables.

The three main points or differences between the weather in these two months will help us understand how successful the surf and ice-cream shop will be.
* The minimum temperature in Oahu in December is about 8 degrees cooler than the minimum temperature in June.
* The maximum temperature in Oahu in December is only 2 degrees cooler than the maximum temperature in June.
* The average temperature in Oahu in December is only about 3 degrees cooler than the average temperature in June.

First, it will help to see the statistical summary for each month's temperatures:
