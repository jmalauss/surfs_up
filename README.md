Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, 
in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. 
You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

For the written analysis: I would want to run a full analysis on other surf and ice-cream shops in Hawaii, and attempt to understand the factors
related to successful business in that cohort.
=======
### Report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.
* Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis:

* Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December: Use images as support where needed.

* Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to provide additional information to W. Avy about temperatures in Oahu so he can make the best decision about opening an ice-cream and surf shop. We needed to collect the temperatures for the months of June and December to see how sustainable the ice-cream sales would be year-round. The summary statistics have been generated for both months so we could easily analyze our findings.

### Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables.

The three main points or differences between the weather in these two months will help us understand how successful the surf and ice-cream shop will be.
* The minimum temperature in Oahu in December is about 8 degrees cooler than the minimum temperature in June.
* The maximum temperature in Oahu in December is only 2 degrees cooler than the maximum temperature in June.
* The average temperature in Oahu in December is only about 3 degrees cooler than the average temperature in June.

First, it will help to see the statistical summary for each month's temperatures:

### Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
