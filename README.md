Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, 
in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. 
You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

For the written analysis: I would want to run a full analysis on other surf and ice-cream shops in Hawaii, and attempt to understand the factors
related to successful business in that cohort.
